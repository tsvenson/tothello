Tothello - Terminal Othello
===========================

Tothello is a code learning project using:

- Python 3.10.x
- `Textual <https://github.com/Textualize/textual>`_ - Uses Textual CSS, so currently needs dev version
- `Rich <https://github.com/Textualize/rich>`_

Developed on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS, with no attempts making it work on other OS's.

The goal is to build an **Othello**-clone that runs in the Bash shell on Linux.
It will have an extremely simple game AI, so one player actually can play against
the computer.
